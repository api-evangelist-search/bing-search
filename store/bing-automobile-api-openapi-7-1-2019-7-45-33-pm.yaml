        So if you have a OpenAPI implementation and an OpenAPI description file
        of a REST API, you can feed that description file to the OpenAPI
        implementation and this implementation now knows how to use the REST
        API, it can generate human readable documentation for you or it could
        even auto generate code to use the REST API in different languages.

        An OpenAPI spec is basically a "model" of the API; a machine-readable
        description of what the API accepts and returns. Without a spec,
        developers who build and publish these APIs spend a bunch of time doing
        "busy work", such as hand-crafting documentation, hand-crafting mock
        servers or test clients.

        This API specification was designed using Apicurio, a design studio that
        supports OpenAPI standards. It is a really simple API that allows
        registering cars to an owner, listing cars for this owner and adding
        passenger to a car.

        Most explanations for why an API design generated from code is
        imperfect, boil down to the fact that good API design is of utmost
        importance for the success of any API. Automated OpenAPI generation, on
        the other hand, allows and tempts us to skip the design stage of the API
        lifecycle.

        Rendering Your OpenAPI specification with Swagger UI. After you have a
        valid OpenAPI specification document that describes your API, you can
        then feed this specification to different tools to parse it and generate
        the interactive documentation similar to the Petstore demo.
