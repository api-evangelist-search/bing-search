        Swagger is a powerful open source framework backed by a large ecosystem
        of tools that helps you design, build, document, and consume your
        RESTful APIs. The way that Swagger works, is that you “swagger-enable”
        your API. In .NET you can do this by including a Nuget package called
        Swashbuckle.

        OpenAPI has become the foundation of modern APIs, yet there are still
        many without proper definitions. Too often, a definition exists, but it
        is only shared internally. With all the tooling available—including more
        than can be covered here—it's time that every API provide its own
        OpenAPI definition.

        In September 2018, we open-sourced OASGraph, a library to auto-generate

        REST APIs not compatible with GraphQL, and makes use of OpenAPI 3.0.0

        produce SDKS for 90+ management services across 7+ languages. Its
        pluggable architecture allows fine-grained control over the generation
        process, and allows extensions to be written in ...
